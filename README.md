# pyside-media-loop
PySide software which can loop the media file (audio file only currently)

You can see a lot of 30 minutes or 10 hrs loop media in Youtube, this works well if you want to make it.

My first PySide software.

The most important thing is, this package doesn't import my other package like the others such as <a href="https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-dark-notepad.git">Dark Notepad</a>(which will be very confusing).

## Requirements
* PySide6
* <a href="https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub">pydub</a> - for media function

## Setup
`pip3 install git+https://github.com/yjg30737/pyside-media-loop.git --upgrade`
